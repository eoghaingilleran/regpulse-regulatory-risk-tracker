The Central Bank expects firms to have effective governance arrangements, with clear roles and responsibilities for the board and senior management.

The board is responsible for ensuring that the firm has a sound risk management framework and appropriate internal controls in place. Firms must ensure that governance arrangements are documented, reviewed regularly and remain appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of the business.

Firms are expected to maintain accurate and complete records to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements and to facilitate effective supervision.

Where weaknesses in governance or internal controls are identified, firms must take timely and effective remedial action.
